         In July 2017, Google announced a new service called Backup & Sync. It was mainly developed to replace the Google Drive Desktop App. Later, the Google Drive application was discontinued by Google. It was developed to fix some specific folders for auto-sync.

Website Interface:
<br>
Google Drive is also available in a website format to access the drive data from the web on any platform. We are not required to download an app to use the drive web version. Its web version is quite useful and provides improved performance. The web version simplifies the basic tasks such as drag and drop functionality or share a file by simply clicking only once.

Its website version has fast and effective performance for some tasks, such as downloading files locally from the website. We can compress and download large files into several 2GB zip files with a specified name.

       <p style="font-size: 20px;text-align: left;">Some useful features of Gdrive are as following:
            <br><br>
         Sharing:
         <br>
         One of its fascinating features is sharing. It allows access to files or folders from your Drive to other users. In the sharing system, the creator of the file is the owner. The owner can set the public visibility of the file or folder. However, ownership can be transfer to others. The files and folders are only sharable to Google users who have a Google account( @gmail.com). It shares the link of the file and folder.
         
         We can also share the file with the users not having a Google account by setting its privacy to "anybody with the link." It will generate a secret URL for the particular file and folder, which can be shared by any medium such as mail or social share. Also, we can set the files and folders as public on the Drive. The public files and folders are indexed by the search engine, which may be accessed by anyone.
         
         Apart from sharing, the owner can set the Access level, which means who can edit, comment, or view the file.
         <br><br>
